To deploy a React app to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Install the `gh-pages` package:
    ```bash
    npm install gh-pages --save-dev
    ```

2. Update the `package.json` file with the following:
    - Add a `homepage` field with the URL of your GitHub Pages site.
    - Add `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts.

    Example `package.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>",
      "scripts": {
         "predeploy": "npm run build",
         "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
      }
    }
    ```

3. Build and deploy the app:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

This will build your React app and push the `build` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository. Your app will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
